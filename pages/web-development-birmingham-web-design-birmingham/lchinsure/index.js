              <Description>
                LCH Insurance is an insurance broker founded in 2021 which
                helped people find cheap vehicle insurance in the UK and Wales.
                For the entire year, LCH Insurance operated by manually
                contacting customers for details which resulted in lengthy phone
                calls and human errors occurring throughout this entire process.
                To mitigate these problems, LCH Insurance contacted Obsidian Web
                Developments to create a web solution, which would automate this
                entire process, reducing costs and time spent.
              </Description>

              <H3 color="black">The solution.</H3>
              <Description>
                In the first step Obsidian Web Developments drafted a plan for
                the creation of an entire new system, compromised of a front-end
                and a back-end. The solution is a website which users could
                visit and fill out a multi-step form, automating this process
                and increasing the turnover rate by 80%. Once the form was
                submitted, it would be sent directly to LCH Insurance which
                could then be processed. To accomplish this, the team had to
                gather all the requirements for this new solution, which would
                be actualized and implemented into a full stack solution.
                <br />
                <br />
                The second step involved creating the software architectural
                patterns for the back-end system which communicates with the
                Google Gmail API, to send the submitted form to LCH Insurance.
                The server used was Node.js as it is fast and quick to set up.
                <br />
                <br />
                After thorough planning and consultation with the management of
                LCH Insurance, development ensued in which the project was
                rigorously tested and created within 10 days. The front-end was
                integrated with the back-end, the secret keys were stored
                securely, and the website was deployed to the cloud, ready to
                use by LCH Insurance.
